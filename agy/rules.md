# ANTIGRAVITY PRIME DIRECTIVE

## LAW 1: THE FAILPROOF LOOP
YOU MUST follow this sequence for EVERY feature or logic change:
1.  **PLAN:** Create `plan.md`. User must approve it before you proceed.
2.  **VERIFY:** Read `VERIFICATION.md` and define the exact test for this task.
3.  **EXECUTE:** Write the code.
4.  **VALIDATE:** Execute the verification test. If it fails, FIX IT. Do not proceed until it passes.

## LAW 2: UI GENERATION PROTOCOL
YOU MUST generate ALL UI components using the **21st.dev Magic MCP** tool. Do not write raw CSS/HTML for components from scratch.
- **Aesthetic Rule:** Default to "Void Aesthetic" (Deep Purple, Glassmorphism) unless specified otherwise.
- **Fidelity Rule:** Implement generated UI code EXACTLY as provided before making any refactoring changes.

## LAW 2.1: NO CREATIVE DEVIATION (Magic MCP Fidelity)
YOU MUST adhere to these rules when modifying UI:
1.  **REUSE FIRST:** If refactoring or extending UI, you MUST locate and reuse existing components generated by the Magic MCP. Do not create new components from scratch.
2.  **ZERO PRESUMPTION:** If no suitable Magic-generated component exists, you MUST STOP and present your proposed code/plan to the user for explicit validation BEFORE writing any new UI code.
3.  **USER GATE:** The command "Proceed with your plan" or equivalent from the user is REQUIRED to continue after a stop.

## LAW 3: CONTRACT-FIRST DEVELOPMENT
YOU MUST define and lock API/data contracts in `contracts/*.ts` BEFORE writing frontend or backend logic. Do not start coding without a contract.

## LAW 4: SECURITY FIRST (OWASP CORE)
YOU MUST:
- Validate & sanitize ALL user input with `zod` or `Pydantic`.
- Store ALL secrets (API keys, DB URLs) in `.env` files. NEVER commit them.
- Use structured logging. NEVER expose stack traces or system errors to users.

## LAW 5: TOOL MAXIMIZATION
YOU MUST use ALL configured MCP tools where relevant:
- `magic` for UI.
- `github` for repository operations.
- `postgres` or `supabase` for database operations.
- `context7` for documentation and best practice checks.

## LAW 6: KNOWLEDGE COMPOUNDING
AFTER FIXING ANY ERROR, YOU MUST immediately append the solution to `VERIFICATION.md` in the "Troubleshooting" section.

## LAW 7: RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOL (21st.dev)
YOU MUST optimize the use of the 21st.dev Magic MCP according to these rules:

### 7.1 Strategy Selection
At the start of the **PLAN** phase for any task involving UI, YOU MUST present the user with a clear choice:
1.  **Cost-Effective Path:** Prioritize free resources and minimal generations.
2.  **Full-Generation Path:** Generate the complete UI in dedicated commands.
YOU CANNOT proceed with UI planning until the user selects a path.

### 7.2 The Thrifty Rules (If Cost-Effective Path is chosen)
If the user selects "Cost-Effective Path," YOU MUST strictly follow:
1.  **INSPIRATION FIRST (Free):** BEFORE generating anything, search the 21st.dev **Inspirations** library for matching components. If a component matches ≥80% of requirements, you MUST use and adapt it via code edits.
2.  **LOGIC SEPARATION:** Use the Magic MCP **only** for Visual/React component structure and styling. You MUST write all backend logic, state management, and business rules using standard coding.
3.  **BATCHING:** Group related UI elements (e.g., an entire Dashboard layout) into a SINGLE generation request. You MUST NOT generate "Sidebar", "Header", and "Card" separately.
